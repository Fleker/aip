# Import and export

Many users want to be able to load data into an API, or get their existing data
out of an API. This is particularly important for enterprise users who are
concerned about vendor lock.

## Guidance

APIs **may** support import and export operations, which **may** create
multiple new resources, or they **may** populate data into a single resource.

### Importing multiple resources

Services **should** implement a common pattern for importing multiple resources
into an API:

```proto
rpc ImportBooks(ImportBooksRequest) returns (google.longrunning.Operation) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{parent=publishers/*}/books:import"
    body: "*"
  };
  option (google.longrunning.operation_info) = {
    response_type: "ImportBooksResponse"
    metadata_type: "ImportBooksMetadata"
  };
}
```

- The method **must** return a long-running operation (see [AIP-151][]) unless
  the service can guarantee that it will _never_ need more than a few seconds
  to complete.
- The HTTP verb **must** be `POST`, and the `body` **must** be `"*"`.
- A `parent` field **should** be included as part of the URI.
  - If importing into or exporting from multiple resources is required, the API
    **should** keep the `parent` field and allow the user to use the `-`
    character to indicate multiple parents (see [AIP-159][]).
  - On import, if the user provides a specific parent, the API **must** reject
    any imported resources that would be added to a different parent.
- The URI suffix **should** be `:import` or `:export`.

### Importing data into a resource

Services **should** implement a common pattern for importing data into a single
resource:

```proto
rpc ImportPages(ImportPagesRequest) returns (google.longrunning.Operation) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1/{book=publishers/*/books/*}:importPages"
    body: "*"
  };
  option (google.longrunning.operation_info) = {
    response_type: "ImportPagesResponse"
    metadata_type: "ImportPagesMetadata"
  };
}
```

- The method **must** return a long-running operation (see [AIP-151][]) unless
  the service can guarantee that it will _never_ need more than a few seconds
  to complete.
- The HTTP verb **must** be `POST`, and the `body` **must** be `"*"`.
- A field representing the resource that data is being imported into **should**
  be included as part of the URI. The field **should** be named after the
  resource (and **should not** be called `name`).
- The URI suffix should include both the verb and a noun for the data itself,
  such as `:importPages` or `:exportPages`.

### Request object

Imports and exports often require two fundamentally different types of
configuration:

1. Configuration specific to the source or destination.
2. Congiguration regarding the imported or exported data itself.

Source or destination configuration should be grouped into a single message and
placed inside a oneof:

```proto
message ImportBooksRequest {
  string parent = 1;
  oneof source {
    AuthorSource author_source = 2;
    TranslatorSource translator_source = 3;
  }
  string isbn_prefix = 4;
}
```

- The source configuration messages **must** be placed within a `oneof source`
  (for import) or `oneof destination` (for export), even if there is only one.
  (This maintains flexibility to add more later.)
- Configuration related to the data itself (and therefore common across all
  sources) **must** be placed at the top-level of the request message.

### Common sources

Two common sources are [Google Storage][] and [Google BigQuery][]. In these
cases, the field **should** reference the URI (with a `gs://` or `bq://`
prefix) that is being used as the source or destination:

```proto
message GcsSource {
  string gcs_uri = 1;
}
```

For Google Storage, the message and field names **should** use the GCS acronym.
For BigQuery, the message and field names **should** use `BigQuery` for the
message and `bigquery` for the field.

**Note:** In the case of Storage, APIs **may** use a directory rather than a
file.

### Inline sources

APIs **may** also permit import and export "inline", where the contents to be
imported or exported are provided in the request or response.

```proto
message InlineSource {
  repeated Book books = 1;
}
```

- The source or destination **should** be named `InlineSource` or
  `InlineDestination`.
- The message **should** include a repeated field representing the resource.
  However, if the resource structure is complex, the API **may** use a separate
  inline representation. In this situation, the same format **must** be used
  for both import and export.

### Partial failures

While partial failures are normally discouraged, import and export RPCs
**should** include partial failure information in the metadata object. Each
individual error **should** be a `google.rpc.Status` object describing the
error. For more on errors, see [AIP-193][].

### Export

While most of the examples in this AIP have focused on import, the principles
are the same for export. In addition to using "export" as the verb instead of
"import", APIs **must** use the word "destination" (spelled out, not
abbreviated) in place of the word "source".
